# MC Simulation Financial Planning

A Python application that leverages Monte Carlo simulation forcasting to perdict portfolio outcomes. This is designed to give direction to when a user can retire based on their holdings. 

## Technologies

This project leverages python3 with the following packages:


* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) - For dataframe processing and CSV reading.

* [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - For reading API keys in a .env file. 

* [alpaca_trade_api](https://pypi.org/project/alpaca-trade-api/) - For gathering data on historical prices. 

* [forecast-tools](https://pypi.org/project/forecast-tools/) - For performing Monte Carlo simulations.
